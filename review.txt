Basic Python Language Syntax
Comments 
	comments are marked by an "#"
		ex: # This line is a comment
	python does not have any multi line comment like in c or c++
Statements 
	end of line typically ends a statement 
	semicolons can be used to have more than one statement on one line

	if you need to continue to the next line, use "\" to indicate it OR you can enclose the entire thing in parenthesis 
		ex: 	x = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +\
    			    5 + 6 + 7 + 8
			--------------------
	       		x = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
     			     5 + 6 + 7 + 8)
Whitespace
	Blocks
		in languages like C blocks are denoted by using curly braces but in python, indentation is used to denote blocks
		indented blocks in python wil always be denoted by the use of a colon, ":"
			recommended indentation is four spaces
	in statement
		whitespace within lines does not matter
			ex: 	x=1+2
				x = 1 + 2
				x             =        1    +                2
			are the same
Parenthesis 
	parenthesis are used for either grouping or for calling
		ex: grouping
			2 * (3 + 4)
		ex: calling
			L = [4,2,3,1]
			L.sort()
			print(L)
			------------
			[1, 2, 3, 4]
			The "()" after sort indicates that the function should be executed, and is required even if no arguments are necessary.
