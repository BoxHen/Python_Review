Python is a completely object oriented program. 

In many programming languages, variables are best thought of as containers or buckets into which you put data. You are essentially defining a "memory bucket" 
named x, and putting the value 4 into it. In Python, by contrast, variables are best thought of not as containers but as pointers. Because Python variables 
just point to various objects, there is no need to "declare" the variable, or even require the variable to always point to information of the same type! 
This is the sense in which people say Python is dynamically-typed: variable names can point to objects of any type. 

Python is not a type-free language. Python has types; however, the types are linked not to the variable names but to the objects themselves.

Creating Variables
	-Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
	-Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
	-A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). 
	-Rules for Python variables:
		-A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
		-A variable name cannot start with a number
		-A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
		-Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
		-Variables are case-sensitive
